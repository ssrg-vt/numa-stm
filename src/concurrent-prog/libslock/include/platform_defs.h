     * For each machine that is used, one needs to define

     *  CORES_PER_SOCKET: the number of cores per socket
     *  CACHE_LINE_SIZE
     *  NOP_DURATION: the duration in cycles of a noop instruction (generally 1 cycle on most small machines)
     *  the_cores - a mapping from the core ids as configured in the OS to physical cores (the OS might not alwas be configured corrrectly)
     *  get_cluster - a function that given a core id returns the socket number ot belongs to
