# CoreFreq
## Purpose
CoreFreq is a CPU monitoring software designed for 64-bits Processors w/ architectures Intel Atom, Core2, Nehalem, SandyBridge and superior, AMD Family 0F

CoreFreq provides a framework to retrieve CPU data with a high degree of precision:

* Core frequencies & ratios; SpeedStep (EIST), Turbo Boost, Hyper-Threading (HTT) and Base Clock
* Performance counters including Time Stamp Counter (TSC), Unhalted Core Cycles (UCC), Unhalted Reference Cycles (URC)
* Number of instructions per cycle or second, IPS, IPC, or CPI
* CPU C-States C0 C1 C3 C6 C7 - C1E - Auto/UnDemotion of C1 C3
* DTS Temperature and Tjunction Max, Thermal Monitoring TM1 TM2 state
* Topology map including Caches for boostrap & application CPU
* Processor features, brand & architecture strings


To reach this goal, CoreFreq implements a Linux Kernel module which employs the followings:

* asm code to keep as near as possible the readings of the performance counters;
* per-CPU, implements slab data memory and high-resolution timer;
* compliant with suspend / resume and CPU Hot-Plug;
* a shared memory to protect kernel from the user-space part of the software;
* atomic synchronization of threads to avoid mutexes and deadlock.

 8- Unload the kernel module with the ```rmmod``` command
```
rmmod corefreqk.ko

## Screenshots
### Linux kernel module
Use ```dmesg``` or ```journalctl -k``` to check if the module is started

### Daemon
```

  Processor [Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 920 @ 2.67GHz]
  Architecture [Nehalem/Bloomfield] 8/8 CPU Online.
```

### Client
Without arguments, the corefreq-cli program displays Top Monitoring  
_Remark_: Drawing will stall if the terminal width is lower than 80 columns, or its height is less than required.

 * With the option '-c', the client traces counters.

 * Using option '-m' corefreq-cli shows the CPU topology

 * With the option '-i' corefreq-cli traces the number of instructions per second / cycle

## ArchLinux
[corefreq-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/corefreq-git) can be installed from the Arch User Repository.

## Debian
 * Install the prerequisite packages.
```
apt-get install dkms git
```
 * As a user, clone and build CoreFreq.
```
git clone https://github.com/cyring/CoreFreq.git
cd CoreFreq
make
```
 * As root, change to the build directory then start the module followed by the daemon.
```
insmod corefreqk.ko
./corefreqd
```
 * As a user, start the client.
```
./corefreq-cli
```

## Q&A

* Q: Turbo Technology is activated however CPUs don't reach those frequencies ?  
  A: In the kernel command argument line, disable nmi_watchdog, if suitable with your setup.  
  ```
nmi_watchdog=0
```

* Q: The CPU ratio does not go above its minimum value ?  
  A: Disable nmi_watchdog and check what is the current idle driver by starting the CoreFreq module with the following argument.  
  ```
insmod corefreqk.ko IdleDriverQuery=1
```
  In the CoreFreq client UI, should be written the driver name beside the Linux version, "intel_idle" is the recommended driver.  

* Q: The deep sleep states do not produce any value ?  
  A: Check if the intel_idle module is running.  
     Accordingly to the Processor specs, provide a max_cstate value in the kernel argument as below.  
  ```
intel_idle.max_cstate=value
```

* Q: The CoreFreq UI refreshes itself slowly, with a delay after the actual CPUs usage ?  
  A: The sampling time to read the counters can be reduced or increased using a CoreFreq module argument:  
  ```
insmod corefreqk.ko SleepInterval=value
```
  where value is supplied in milliseconds between a minimum of 500 ms and a maximum of 5000 ms. 1000 ms is the default value.  

* Q: The base clock reports a wrong frequency value ?  
  A: CoreFreq uses various algorithms to estimate the base clock.  
     1- The delta of two TimeStampCounter reads in the interval of 1000 ms  
     2- The value provided in the Processor brand string divided by the maximum ratio (without Turbo)  
     3- A static value advertised by the manufacturer specs.  
     4- The MSR_FSB_FREQ bits provided with the Core, Core2 and Atom architectures.  
     The algorithms # 2, 3 and 4 will not return any under/over-clock frequency.  
     The CoreFreq module can be started as follow to ignore the first algorithm (frequency estimation):  
  ```
insmod corefreqk.ko AutoClock=0
```

* Q: The CPU temperature is wrong ?  
  A: CoreFreq employs two msr to calculate the temperature.
  ```
MSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET - MSR_IA32_THERM_STATUS [DTS]
```
  If the MSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET is not provided by the Processor, a default value of 100 degree Celsius is considered as a target.
