- Do we really need a hypercall for notifying the hypervisor?
  - One approach is to check during the VMExit and have a deadline
  scheduling priority for once. The RCU readers will keep on running
  for a predefined duration and will then be kicked out. After that,
  all we need to do is check the vcpu spin variable again and downgrade
  the scheduling policy to a normal.
