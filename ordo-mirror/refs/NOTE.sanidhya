- develop a micro benchmark that runs n threads on all the machines with
  SCHED_RR policy on all cores and then determine the time gap between all
  the cores across all NUMA domains.
    - this will give us the time difference between each core and how much do they
      vary...
    - then create a table and try to sync all the vcpu threads on the kvmclock
